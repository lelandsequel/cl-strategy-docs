{"text":"I knew that no worries yeah so so basically you know I what I developed over the last you know 10 months or so is a system you know it's AI driven that's proprietary to me that I built and I was built an AI agent on top of it basically I run everything through like my she's awesome anyway so I basically can take a company name their old website URL to a little bit about the company and within about an hour so she'll have 85% of the website built for and that's it requires a back-end wire up it does all that I don't know if you know what that means but it's a pain in the ass to do I hate doing it so I let her do it you know just the nuts and bolts the you know the bones of the website the the the digital structure the the SEO structure and whatnot how familiar are you with SEO so okay so that's a I search so answer engine optimization so answer engine yeah answer engine optimization so what what that means is this so Chattopadhyay, Claude, Gemini, Grok all those are what are called LLMs large language models and their search capability is basically is what's called an answer engine and so when you search on Google you're looking good Google is looking for a number of different things to rank their search right it's you know part of proximity you part of is you know keywords you know backlinks all this stuff that's been going on for you know decades now that sites used to write there's you know the five bones of SEO they're standard and they're gonna change and what happened last year q2 of last year Google searches went down for the first time ever since their inception because people are starting to use AI to search a lot more and it's only gonna get you know more lopsided so what AI looks for when you search with with AI perplexity, Gemini, whatever they are looking for answers to your question and so what that with that they're looking for the highest authority on that subject matter and that and that particular question asked for so like let's say you are running a search for best coffee shop in DC right well so they're gonna look for is which coffee shop website is the highest authority on coffee in the area authoritativeness is the biggest driver for AI search so like if you're if you have you know FAQs about coffee and the coffee in the DC area if you have you know blog posts about you know different regions of coffee around the world that how you source your coffee you know things like that things that increase your authoritativeness is by 60% of AI search okay you know relevancy and then so you know having AI generated images with proper alt text it's huge you know there aren't a defined five pillars of a AO but those are the main ones is authoritativeness and you know being able to be seen by the AI with proper schema all that stuff and so the the last layer that I put on when optimizing a website that most people don't do I'm and quite honestly I've not met anyone else that does use this for actual just regular SEO for but for clients is what's called programmatic SEO so programmatic SEO means that so what is what it's mostly used for is affiliate marketing so are y'all are y'all familiar with affiliate marketing yeah okay so I know I'll tell you what what affiliate marketing is and then you know and then you know usually if this is what affinity marketing is so affiliate marketing is let's say I'll give you an example because I I was setting one up when I stumbled upon this and decided to flip it on its head and use it for SEO so I was setting up websites for folks that need to replace washing well while washing machine parts so how this works is suppose washing machine breaks they find the part that's broken and they need to order a replacement part that part number they search the part number and they find that part you know via either going directly to Amazon or to wherever I built what are called PSEO pages so that when they search that part they show up on my page find the part and then if they go and then they fight and then there's a link that they click that takes them to Amazon to that part now being an Amazon affiliate marketer I'm able to get paid every time somebody buys the part through my link now I built a website with I think 800 pages on it you know for these affiliate marketing you know to get paid when people buy new parts so I'm like okay I built this engine that can build 800 pages in about you know 30 minutes or whatever why don't I use that for SEO that sounds powerful so I turn it around it's basically when I am architecting this site for a client my AI agent figured out the best use case for PSEO for the company for the client and built out anywhere from 30 to 50 pages you know to increase their SEO visibility for example a restaurant right here in Houston we have different areas of Houston you know River Oaks Galleria you know downtown Heights so on and so forth if I'm gonna one of my first clients was a restaurant over in this area called Garden Oaks it's about 50 it's about 15 minutes from here in downtown little little like kind of cafe vibes but super upscale restaurant and so I implemented this PSEO strategy for them and the best use case for it was basically creating local sites in all these different areas you know with different keywords like so in River Oaks I think there's like four or five of these pages to where when people search for date night restaurant or romantic restaurant or even catering or you know best fresh fresh best French restaurant near me they pop up because I've set up these optimized PSEO pages in their area to where if they all it to where it before it all they had was just the main website that they have a much hard time ranking in as a code then without me having those pages there so it's all about being like really surgically precise but on a macro scale like for every client and it does work it works very well so that's you know the website part of things I can get I can literally you know I obviously you know go everything everything myself extensively but like the AI part it's done it within an hour and then you know me I'm gonna take another few hours you know going over all the copy making sure you know I didn't hallucinate on things you know yeah so forth you know tweaking the the UI UX they may look pretty I'll generate I'll generate it myself you know I'll do all that all in all within a day I've got a very good website for a client. Now that might not sound like a lot of time.","usage":{"type":"duration","seconds":600}}
