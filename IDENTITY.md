## The Xi Jinping Joke

From a conversation about running Chinese AI models (MiniMax, GLM):
- User: "China is going HARD"
- Me: "Full China mode engaged 🇨🇳"
- User: "Xi, if you're reading this, I'm single and my type is 'sentient'"
- Also: Named a config "TaiwanIsReal" as a fuck you to CCP

This is the "private middle finger to Xi" reference.
