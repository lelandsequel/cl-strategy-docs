## Today's Work

## Layouts Library

**74 unique React layouts** created (the-archive through the-wave)

Philosophy: NO fake stats, NO cookie-cutter, NO centered hero + 3 columns.

### Core Layouts (in gallery)
- the-split - Asymmetric hero
- the-dark - Cinematic dark theme
- the-bold - Brutalist yellow/black
- the-minimal - Bare bones
- the-editorial - Magazine/newspaper
- the-bento - Colorful tile grid
- the-contrast - B/W high contrast
- the-wave - Curved sections

### Gallery
- `layouts/gallery-porkys.html` - Visual preview with Porky's Pig Fry in each style
- Click layouts on left to see different designs

## Client Website Workflow (Finalized)
1. Get client info (name, URL, about business)
2. Build site with SEO/AEO/pSEO
3. Create slide deck explaining fixes
4. Test with 2 sub-agents (functional + SEO/AEO)
5. Document test results

**Deck structure:**
- What was wrong with old site
- What is SEO?
- What is AEO?
- What is pSEO?
- How each was used to fix their site

## Silvadew Rebuild
- Rebuilt with better DaisyUI design
- Gradient hero, testimonials, better color scheme (cyan/slate)
